### Program and Data Representation Work 💻☕️

A semester's worth of work for Program and Data Representation. Plenty of work with C++, along with x86 Assembly and C.
It was an entire semester of working with low-level code, which I loved, as I am a Computer Engineer.
This class had a tough learning curve initially. I quickly got up to speed with Computer Science fundamentals through hours of hard work, through learning about various data structures and implementing them in code. By the end of the semester, I mastered various structures, from trees, to min/max-heaps, to stacks, to linked lists, to basically every data structure out there.
